## Dev Log

### 10 Jan 2018
Redesign of the core network data communication flow.

By this point, more than 2 weeks has gone into finding a way to simplify the data flow as much as possible. The following diagram is the plan for the redesigned flow, taking into account everything learnt during the past 2 weeks, which is all documented in the [development planning document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Estd98wO1ABEChAnwoZS_0E2ZXc-1mPSaiMIrXe-uvY/edit?usp=sharing).
